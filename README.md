# MIPS-Matlab_command_prompt
Simple MATLAB command prompt design by MIPS assembly
This code creates a simple MATLAB command prompt that takes one digit user inputs and does arithmetic operations in 
between those inputs.
However,I just did not bother writing different segments to do different arithmetic. I just replaced the sign and the operand every time for different arithmetic in line 116 and 149 and line 269. The changes for example, replacing '+' sign with '-' and in line 149 replacing operand 'add' with 'sub'.
